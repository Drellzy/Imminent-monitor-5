## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.ibb.co/mbxkcMn/imminent-monitor-5-cracked.png)

Imminent Monitor was a very RAT, very cheap and reliable.
In 2012, a developer, “Shockwave™”, registered the domain imminentmethods[.]info, and in April 2013 started selling his “Imminent Monitor” RAT on online forums and at his site, which later changed to imminentmethods[.]net. Earlier in 2012, he had offered a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) tool, “Shockwave™Booter,” but seemed to drop that project in favor of his new RAT.
